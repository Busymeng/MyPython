"""
   * Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, split 
     the line into a list of words using the split() method. The program 
     should build a list of words. For each word on each line check to see 
     if the word is already in the list and if not append it to the list. 
     When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in 
     alphabetical order.

"""
   * Open the file mbox-short.txt and read it line by line. When you find 
     a line that starts with 'From ' like the following line:
        From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
     You will parse the From line using split() and print out the second word 
     in the line (i.e. the entire address of the person who sent the message).
     Then print out a count at the end.
     Hint: make sure not to include the lines that start with 'From:'.
